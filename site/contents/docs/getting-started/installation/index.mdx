<Note type="note" title="üìÑ Attention">
    This dotfiles configuration is written with NixOS systems in mind. While it may work on other Linux distributions, it is optimized and tailored specifically for NixOS. You may need to make adjustments for compatibility if you're using a different distribution.
</Note>

There are two ways to install these dotfiles:

   - <a href="#automated-installation">Automated Installation (Script)</a>: This method uses a script to automatically set up the dotfiles. However, the script is a bit messy and not perfect, so it may require some adjustments.
   - <a href="#manual-installation">Manual Installation (Recommended)</a>: This is the preferred method, giving you full control over the installation process and allowing you to customize each dotfile according to your needs.

It‚Äôs recommended to use the manual installation for a more reliable and tailored setup.

## Manual Installation
To get started, you can clone the dotfiles repository directly from GitHub.

      <TabsTrigger value="HTTPS">HTTPS</TabsTrigger>
      <TabsTrigger value="SSH">SSH</TabsTrigger>
    </TabsList>

        <Note title="Remember">
      You can use the <i className="text-xl font-extrabold text-pink-300">install.sh</i> script while booted into a system or in the live installer.
      If you prefer the latter, you can obtain an ISO from official NixOS site.
      The minimal ISO is recommended, but you can use any.
